  1. Advanced Persistent Threat
  
An advanced persistent threat (APT) is a network attack in which an unauthorized person gains access to a network and stays there undetected for a long period of time. The intention of an APT attack is to steal data rather than to cause damage to the network or organization.

  2. backdoor
  
  
A back door is a means of access to a computer program that bypasses security mechanisms. A programmer may sometimes install a back door so that the program can be accessed for troubleshooting or other purposes. However, attackers often use back doors that they detect or install themselves, as part of an exploit.

  3. botnet
  
A botnet is a collection of compromised computers often referred to as "zombies" infected with malware that allows an attacker to control them.

  4. brute force
  
Brute force (also known as brute force cracking) is a trial and error method used by application programs to decode encrypted data such as passwords or Data Encryption Standard (DES) keys, through exhaustive effort (using brute force) rather than employing intellectual strategies.

  5. exploit
  
a software tool designed to take advantage of a flaw in a computer system, typically for malicious purposes such as installing malware.

  6. key logger
  
A keylogger is a type of surveillance software (considered to be either software or spyware) that has the capability to record every keystroke you make to a log file, usually encrypted. A keylogger recorder can record instant messages, e-mail, and any information you type at any time using your keyboard.
  
  7. logic bomb
  
a set of instructions secretly incorporated into a program so that if a particular condition is satisfied they will be carried out, usually with harmful effects.

  8. Macro virus

A macro virus is a computer virus that "infects" a Microsoft Word or similar application and causes a sequence of actions to be performed automatically when the application is started or something else triggers it. Macro viruses tend to be surprising but relatively harmless.
  
  9. port scan

Port Scan - Computer Definition. A port scan or port scanner attempts to connect to all 65536 ports on a server to see whether there are services listening (that is, waiting for connections) on those ports. The purpose of a port scan is to audit network computers for likely vulnerabilities or exploits.

  10. ransomware

A type of malicious software designed to block access to a computer system until a sum of money is paid.

  11. rootkit

A rootkit is a type of software designed to hide the fact that an operating system has been compromised, sometimes by replacing vital executables. Rootkits allow viruses and malware to “hide in plain sight” by disguising as necessary files that your antivirus software will overlook.

  12. worm
  
A computer worm is a standalone malware computer program that replicates itself in order to spread to other computers. Often, it uses a computer network to spread itself, relying on security failures on the target computer to access it. Unlike a computer virus, it does not need to attach itself to an existing program.

  13. zero day

A zero-day vulnerability is an undisclosed computer-software vulnerability that hackers can exploit to adversely affect computer programs, data, additional computers or a network

  14. zombie

In computer science, a zombie is a computer connected to the Internet that has been compromised by a hacker, computer virus or trojan horse program and can be used to perform malicious tasks of one sort or another under remote direction.
